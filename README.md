Thoughts, standards and conventions for Workflow Description Language

WDL is a workflow description language. Several workflow engines allow you to execute WDL. Here, we focus on Cromwell.

This repo is devoted to thinking about the *way* to write WDL, more so than the specifics of WDL. Like any programming language, there are a number of ways to do the same thing. But not all ways make sense for readibility, portability, etc.
